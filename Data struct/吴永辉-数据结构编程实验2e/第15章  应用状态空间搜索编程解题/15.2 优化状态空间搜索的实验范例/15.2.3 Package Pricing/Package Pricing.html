<P>The Green Earth Trading Company sells 4 different sizes of energy-efficient 
 fluorescent light bulbs for use in home lighting fixtures. The light bulbs are 
 expensive, but last much longer than ordinary incandescent light bulbs and 
 require much less energy. To encourage customers to buy and use the energy-
 efficient light bulbs, the company catalogue lists special packages which 
 contain a variety of sizes and numbers of the light bulbs. The price of a 
 package is always substantially less than the total price of the individual 
 bulbs in the package. Customers typically want to buy several different sizes 
 and numbers of bulbs. You are to write a program to determine the least 
 expensive collection of packages that satisfy any customer's request. 
<P>

<P>The input file is divided into two parts. The first one describes the 
packages  which are listed in the catalogue. The second part describes 
individual  customer requests. The 4 sizes of light bulbs are identified in the 
input file  by the characters ``<TT>a</TT>", ``<TT>b</TT>", ``<TT>c</TT>", and 
``<TT>d</TT>". 
<P>
<P>The first part of the input file begins with an integer <I>n</I> ( <IMG 
width="81" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline44" src="Package%20Pricing_files/233img1.gif"> 
) indicating the number of packages described in the catalogue. Each of the 
<I>n</I> lines that follows is a single package description. A package 
description  begins with a catalogue number (a positive integer) followed by a 
price (a  real number), and then the sizes and corresponding numbers of the 
light bulbs  in the package. Between 1 and 4 different sizes of light bulbs will 
be listed  in each description. The listing format for these size-number pairs 
is a  blank, a character (``<TT>a</TT>", ``<TT>b</TT>", ``<TT>c</TT>", or 
``<TT>d</TT>") representing a size, another blank, and then an integer 
representing the number of light bulbs of that size in the  package. These 
size-number pairs will not appear in any particular order, and  there will be no 
duplicate sizes listed in any package. The following line  describes a package 
with catalogue number 210 and price $76.95 which contains 3 size ``<TT>a</TT>" 
bulbs, 1 size ``<TT>c</TT>" bulb, and 4 size ``<TT>d</TT>" bulbs.

<P>
<P>The second part of the input file begins with a line containing a single
 positive integer <I>m</I> representing the number of customer requests. Each of 
the remaining <I>m</I> lines is a customer request. A listing of sizes and 
corresponding numbers of light bulbs constitutes a request. Each list contains 
only the  size-number pairs, formatted the same way that the size-number pairs 
are  formatted in the catalogue descriptions. Unlike the catalogue descriptions, 
 however, a customer request may contain duplicate sizes. The following line 
 represents a customer request for 1 size ``<TT>a</TT>" bulb, 2 size 
``<TT>b</TT>" bulbs, 2 size ``<TT>c</TT>" bulbs, and 5 size ``<TT>d</TT>" bulbs.

<P>For each request, print the customer number (1 through <I>m</I>, 1 for the 
first customer request, 2 for the second,  <IMG width="20" height="2" align="BOTTOM" 
alt="tex2html_wrap_inline54" src="Package%20Pricing_files/233img2.gif"> , 
<I>m</I> for the  <IMG width="26" height="15" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline58" 
src="Package%20Pricing_files/233img3.gif">  customer), a colon, the total price 
of the packages which constitute the least expensive way to fill  the request, 
and then the combination of packages that the customer should  order to fill 
that request. 
<P>
<P>Prices should be shown with exactly two significant digits to the right of 
the  decimal. The combination of packages must be written in ascending order of 
 catalogue numbers. If more than one of the same type package is to be ordered, 
 then the number ordered should follow the catalogue number in parentheses. You 
 may assume that each customer request can be filled. In some cases, the least 
 expensive way to fill a customer request may contain more light bulbs of some 
 sizes than necessary to fill the actual request. This is acceptable. What 
 matters is that the customers receive <I>at least</I> what they request.
