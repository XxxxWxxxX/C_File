<p>
Computer graphics, image processing, and GIS (geographic information systems) all
make use of a data structure
called a quadtree. Quadtrees represent regional or block data efficiently
and support efficient algorithms for
operations like the union and intersection of images.

</p><p>
A quadtree for a black and white image is constructed by successively
dividing the image into four equal quadrants.
If all the pixels in a quadrant are the same color (all black or all white)
the division process for that quadrant stops.
Quadrants that contain both black and white pixels are subdivided into
four equal quadrants and this process
continues until each subquadrant consists of either all black or all
white pixels. It is entirely possible that some
subquadrants consist of a single pixel.

</p><p>
For example, using <tt>0</tt> for white and <tt>1</tt> for black, the region on the
left below is represented by the matrix of zeros and
ones in the middle. The matrix is divided into subquadrants as shown on
the right where gray squares represent
subquadrants that consist entirely of black pixels.

<p>
A quadtree is constructed from the block structure of an image. The root of
the tree represents the entire array of
pixels. Each non-leaf node of a quadtree has four children, corresponding to
the four subquadrants of the region
represented by the node. Leaf nodes represent regions that consist of pixels of
the same color and thus are not
subdivided. For example, the image shown above, with the block structure
on the right, is represented by the quadtree below.

<img width="435" height="191" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./Spatial Structures_files/p806b.jpg" alt="\epsfbox{p806b.eps}">
</div>

<p>
Leaf nodes are white if they correspond to a block of all white pixels, and
black if they correspond to a block of all
black pixels. In the tree, each leaf node is numbered corresponding to
the block it represents in the diagram above.
The branches of a non-leaf node are ordered from left-to-right as shown
for the northwest, northeast, southwest, and
southeast quadrants (or upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right).

</p><p>
A tree can be represented by a sequence of numbers representing the root-to-leaf
paths of black nodes. Each path is a
base five number constructed by labeling branches
with 1, 2, 3, or 4 with NW = 1, NE = 2, SW = 3, SE = 4, and
with the least significant digit of the base five number corresponding to
the branch from the root. For example, the
node labeled 4 has path NE, SW which is <span class="MATH">32<sub>5</sub></span> (base 5) or <span class="MATH">17<sub>10</sub></span> (base 10);
the node labeled 12 has path SW, SE or
<!-- MATH
 $43_5 = 23_{10}$
 -->
<span class="MATH">43<sub>5</sub> = 23<sub>10</sub></span> ; and the node labeled 15 has path SE, SW, NW
or <!-- MATH
 $134_5 = 44_{10}$
 -->
<span class="MATH">134<sub>5</sub> = 44<sub>10</sub></span> . The entire tree is represented by the
sequence of numbers (in base 10)

<p>
Write a program that converts images into root-to-leaf paths and converts root-to-leaf
paths into images.

</p><p>

</p><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input contains one or more images. Each image is square, and the data for
an image starts with an integer <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>,
where <span class="MATH">| <i>n</i>|</span> is the length of a side of the square (always a power of two,
with <span class="MATH">| <i>n</i>| &#8804; 64</span>) followed by a representation of
the image. A representation is either a sequence of <span class="MATH"><i>n</i><sup>2</sup></span> zeros and ones comprised
of <span class="MATH">| <i>n</i>|</span> lines of <span class="MATH">| <i>n</i>|</span> digits per line, or
the sequence of numbers that represent the root-to-leaf paths of each
black node in the quadtree that represents the image.

<p>
If <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> is positive, the zero/one representation follows; if <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> is negative,
the sequence of black node path numbers (in
base 10) follows. The sequence is terminated by the number <tt>-1</tt>. A one-node tree
that represents an all-black image is
represented by the number <tt>0</tt>. A one-node tree that represents an all-white
image is represented by an empty sequence (no numbers).

</p><p>
The end of data is signaled by a value of <tt>0</tt> for <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>.

</p><p>

</p><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each image in the input, first output the number of the image, as shown in
the sample output. Then output the
alternate form of the image.

<p>
If the image is represented by zeros and ones, the output consists of
root-to-leaf paths of all black nodes in the
quadtree that represents the image. The values should be base 10 representations
of the base 5 path numbers, and the
values should be printed in sorted order. If there are more than 12 black nodes,
print a newline after every 12 nodes.
The total number of black nodes should be printed after the path numbers.

</p><p>
If the image is represented by the root-to-leaf paths of black nodes, the
output consists of an ASCII representation of
the image with the character `<tt>.</tt>' used for white/zero and the
character `<tt>*</tt>' used for black/one. There should be <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
characters per line for an <!-- MATH
 $n \times n$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i>×<i>n</i></span> image.
</p><p>Print a blank line between cases.
