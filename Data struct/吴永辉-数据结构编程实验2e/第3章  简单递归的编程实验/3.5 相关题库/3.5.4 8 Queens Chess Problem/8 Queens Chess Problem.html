<P>In chess it is possible to place eight queens on the board so that no one
 queen can be taken by any other. Write a program that will determine all such 
possible arrangements for eight queens given the initial position of one of the 
queens. 
<P>Do not attempt to write a program which evaluates every possible 8
 configuration of 8 queens placed on the board. This would require 8<SUP>8</SUP>
 evaluations and would bring the system to its knees. There will be a reasonable 
run time constraint placed on your program.  
<P>
<H2><FONT color="#0070e8"><A name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </H2>Input to your program will be two numbers separated 
by a blank. The numbers represent the square on which one of the eight queens 
must be positioned. A valid square will be represented; it will not be necessary 
to validate the input. 
<P>To standardize our notation, assume that the upper left-most corner of the
 board is position (1,1). Rows run horizontally and the top row is row 1.
 Columns are vertical and column 1 is the left-most column. Any reference to a 
square is by row then column; thus square (4,6) means row 4, column 6.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </H2>Output from your program will consist of a 
one-line-per-solution representation. 
<P>Each solution will be sequentially numbered <IMG width="55" height="15" 
align="BOTTOM" alt="$1 \dots N$" src="8%20Queens%20Chess%20Problem_files/750img1.gif" 
border="0">. Each solution will consist of 8 numbers. Each of the 8 numbers will 
be the ROW coordinate for that solution. The column coordinate will be indicated 
by the order in which the 8 numbers are printed. That is, the first number 
represents the ROW in which the queen is positioned in column 1; the second 
number represents the ROW in which the queen is positioned in column 2, and so 
on. 
<P>The sample input below produces 4 solutions. The full 8<IMG width="18"

<P>Submit only the one-line, 8 digit representation of each solution as 
described earlier. Solution #1 below indicates that there is a queen at Row 1, 
Column 1; Row 5, Column 2; Row 8, Column 3; Row 6, Column 4; Row 3,Column 5; ... 
Row 4, Column 8. 
<P>Include the two lines of column headings as shown below in the sample output 
and print the solutions in lexicographical order.
